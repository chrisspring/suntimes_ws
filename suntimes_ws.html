<h1>Implementing a Web Service using CXF in an OSGi bundle</h1>

This article describes in detail how to implement a Web Service using
Apache CXF in an OSGi environment. The Web Service endpoint is configured
using an OSGi Blueprint XML file, with the actual implementation in 
good old-fashioned Java code. The example has been tested on Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1 and Fabric8, although I would expect it to work in other OSGi containers
if the necessary CXF dependencies are installed. 
This example uses Maven as a build tool, as there are simply
too many dependencies to manage using simple scripts. In addition, we
can take advantage of the Maven Fabric8 plugin to deploy the code on a
Fuse/Fabric8 cluster. However, as with
all my Apache integration articles, the principles are explained in
considerable detail. No clever IDE tools are required -- all the source
in the article can be, and was, written using a text editor.
<p/>
This article builds on many of my preceding ones, and I assume a knowledge
of OSGi, Fabric8/Fuse, CXF Web Services, and Maven. Implied in
that list of prerequisites is some working knowledge of Web Services in general,
and particularly their implementation in Java.
<p/>
If you are not familiar with the Fabric8 architecture at all, 
then I would recommend that you read <a href="simplefabrictest.html">Deploying 
an OSGi application on Apache Fabric8, from the ground up</a>. If you're
not familiar with OSGi either, then before reading that article I would recommend
<a href="osgitest">Creating OSGI bundles and services from the ground up using 
Apache Karaf</a>. 
<p/>
The procedure in this article has been tested on Fedora 20 Linux, although
there's no particular reason to think that there is anything platform-specific
about it.

<p/>
This article describes 'code first' development of a Web Service, that is,
we start from a Java interface and elaborate that into a service. The
alternative 'contract first' approach, which starts with a WSDL definition,
is described from first principles in the article
<a href="cxftest.html">Creating a Web Service using Apache CXF from the ground up</a>. Alternatively, a more complex example of contract-first Web Service
development is given in <a href="camelcxfservertest.html">Implementing a Web Service using Camel in an OSGi bundle</a>

<h2>Coding the Web Service</h2>

The Web Service in this example goes slightly beyond "Hello, World" -- 
it is a service that can calculate the sunrise and sunset (in UTC time)
at a specific latitude and longitude on a specific date. I'm not
going to describe the mathematics in this article, which is about
Web Services and not astrophysics. However, all the implementation
classes are in the source code bundle and, I hope, reasonably well 
documented.  

<h3>Coding the interface</h3>

The Web Service will expose two methods only -- one for sunrise time, and
one for sunset. So we start the development by writing an interface
that describes those methods. This interface is called
<code>SunTimesSEI</code>, where 'SEI' stands for Service Endpoint Interface.

<pre class="codeblock" lang="java">
package net.kevinboone.apacheintegration.suntimes_ws;
import javax.jws.*;

@WebService(name="SunTimesWS") 
public interface SunTimesSEI 
  {
  public String getSunsetTimeUTC (@WebParam(name="year") int year, 
      @WebParam(name="month") int month, 
      @WebParam(name="day") int day, 
      @WebParam(name="longitude") double longitude, 
      @WebParam(name="latitude") double latitude)
    throws SunTimesException;

  public String getSunriseTimeUTC (@WebParam(name="year") int year, 
      @WebParam(name="month") int month, 
      @WebParam(name="day") int day, 
      @WebParam(name="longitude") double longitude, 
      @WebParam(name="latitude") double latitude)
    throws SunTimesException;
  }
</pre>

Apart from the annotations, this is a perfectly ordinary Java interface.
The <code>WebService</code> annotation marks this as a Web Service with
the specified name. The <code>@WebParam</code> annotations provide names
for the various arguments to the methods, as they will appear in 
the WSDL file. These annotations are important in making the WSDL
file (more) readable; by default the WSDL generator tooling will simply
name these arguments <code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1</code>. The 
rationale for this odd-seeming implementation detail is described
in the  
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CXF/FAQ">CXF FAQ</a>.
<p/>
Note that I have rather lazily organized the Service implementation to 
return the time in a String, rather than some Java data type. For 
demonstration purposes, it's slightly less fiddly to do this, and makes
the XML a whole lot more comprehensible, than using an object type.


<h3>Coding the implementation class</h3>

The implementation class contains the bodies of the methods exposed
in the Service Endpoint Interface, along with whatever other logic
is necessary. In this simple example, the entire application logic is
in this one class; that wouldn't necessarily be a good practice in a 
real application. The skeleton of the class is as follows:

<pre class="codeblock" lang="java">
@javax.jws.WebService(endpointInterface
  ="net.kevinboone.apacheintegration.suntimes_ws.SunTimesSEI") 
public class SunTimes implements SunTimesSEI
{
public String getSunsetTimeUTC (int year, int month, int day, 
      double longitude, double latitude)
    throws SunTimesException
  {
  // Calulation logic here...
  }

public String getSunriseTimeUTC (int year, int month, int day, 
      double longitude, double latitude)
    throws SunTimesException
  {
  // Calulation logic here...
  }
}
</pre>

Note that we must, again, annotate the class as a <code>@WebService</code>,
but in the implementation class the annotation specifies the location
of the corresponding Service Endpoint Interface. Other than that, in 
this simple example, this is a perfectly ordinary Java class that implements
the methods in an interface. 
<p/>
In fact, the CXF tooling can work directly on a class, so strictly speaking
it's not necessary to use an interface at all. However, for all but the
simplest services, that's unlikely to be a scalable approach to development.

<h3>Generating the WSDL</h3>

<b>Generating a WSDL file is an optional step in this example, as it
is not strictly necessary.</b> The CXF implementation can generate a
WSDL file from a Java interface, but it can do it just as well at
runtime as at compile time, and that's what happens if this step is
missed out. However, I'm including the details here because in many 
projects you will need an explicity WSDL file before the service is
actually running.
<p/>
Since we're starting with Java, we need
the <code>java2ws</code> tool to generate the WSDL, but as we're using
Maven, it's easier to use the Maven <code>cxf-java2ws-plugin</code>
plugin to integrate this into the build process. If you look in 
the <code>pom.xml</code> file, you'll see the specification
for the plugin, which is essentially boilerplate code, apart from
the element that indicates the interface that forms the SEI:

<pre class="codeblock" lang="xml">
  <plugin>
        //...
        <artifactId>cxf-java2ws-plugin</artifactId>
            //...
            <configuration>
              <className>
                net.kevinboone.apacheintegration.suntimes_ws.SunTimesSEI
              </className>
            </configuration>
            <goals>
              <goal>java2ws</goal>
            </goals>
      </plugin>
</pre>

We can generate the WSDL using 

<pre class="codeblock">
$ <b>mvn generate-sources</b>
</pre>

but there's no particular need to, as the usual build processes will
do it implicitly.

<h3>Specifying the endpoint in a Blueprint XML file</h3>

The final development step is to specify the Web Services endpoint, 
and thereby link the URL that clients will invoke with the class
that provides the implementation. In a Blueprint XML file this
is trivially easy; the essential elements are shown below. 

<pre class="codeblock" lang="xml">
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
       xmlns:jaxws="http://cxf.apache.org/blueprint/jaxws"
    ...>

    <jaxws:endpoint id="myservice"
      implementor="net.kevinboone.apacheintegration.suntimes_ws.SunTimes"
      address="/suntimes_ws"/>
</blueprint>
</pre>

@notebox(We need to be a bit careful about the <code>xmlns:jaxws</code> namespace here -- it must specifically be <code>blueprint/jaxws</code>. If you've seen examples of CXF endpoints configured using Spring, you'll probably be more used to <code>http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws</code>. Getting this wrong will not stop the bundle from building, but will lead to a slew of incomprehensible error messages at deployment time. 
<p/>
The <code>implementor</code> attribute specifies the class that implements 
the SEI (and thus provides the actual functionality). <code>address</code> 
is the URL of the service <i>as it is presented to CXF</i>. In Fuse/Fabric8
this will <i>not</i> be the URL requested by clients, as this is
configurable. By default, Fuse/Fabric8 puts <code>/cxf</code> in front of
this URL, to separate CXF requests from requests on the Web console and
other administrative interfaces.

<h2>Building the Web Service and deploying on Fuse/Fabric8</h2>

Building should be as simple as

<pre class="codeblock">
$ <b>mvn install</b>
</pre>

which will also put the compiled OSGi bundle into the local Maven
repository, where it can be retried by Fuse/Fabric/Karaf.

<h3>Deploying on a stand-alone Fuse (or Karaf, or ServiceMix) installation</h3>

If the compiled bundle is in the local repository, then we can deploy 
on an installation of Fuse/Fabric8 on the same machine as follows:

<pre class="codeblock">
JBossFuse:karaf@root&gt; osgi:install -s mvn:net.kevinboone.apacheintegration/suntimes_ws/0.0.0.1
</pre>

A similar procedue should work on Karaf or ServiceMix, except that you'll need
to add CXF support first, using a command such as <code>features:install
cxf</code>.
<p/>
An alternative procedure is to copy the JAR file containing the bundle
(from the <code>target</code> directory) to some convenient location,
and install it using, for example, <code>osgi:install file://somefile</code>.
 

<h3>Deploying on a fabric</h3>

Deploying on a fabric is complicated by the fact that, other than on the
root container, we can't simply use <code>osgi:install</code>. Instead, 
software must be placed in a repository (the fabric's own repository will
do), and then added to a profile. The profile can then be added to 
a container, which will install the application. 
<p/>
The most convenient way to do this is to use the Fabric8 Maven plugin,
which requires a simple addition to the <code>pom.xml</code>. The configuration
specifies the URL of the fabric server to which to deploy, and then the
deployment process is as simple as

<pre class="codeblock">
$ <b>mvn fabric8:deploy</b>
</pre>

This process does not install the software in an actual container; instead
it creates a profile whose name, in this case, will be
<code>Net.Kevinboone.Apacheintegration/suntimes_ws</code> (this name is
derived from the Maven coordinates). This profile is ready to add
to a container -- you'll need to add <code>Feature/CXF</code> profile 
as well, if you're not deploying on the root container.
<p/>
For a more detailed explanation of the Fabric8 Maven plug-in, see my article
<a href="camelfabrictest">Using the Fabric8 Maven plugin to deploy a Camel route to a fabric</a>.


<h2>Testing the Web Service using SoapUI</h2>

Before trying to execute the Web Service, a simple sanity test is to 
retrieve the WSDL
for the service can be using a Web browser. The conventional URL for the WSDL 
is the service
URL with <code>?wsdl</code> appended  which, in this case,
will be a URL of the form<code>http://localhost:8181/cxf/suntimes_ws?wsdl</code>.
<p/>
SoapUI is a general-purpose Web Services testing tool. Binaries are
available for many platforms from the 
<a href="http://www.soapui.org/Downloads/">SoapUI</a> Web site. There
isn't space here to describe how to install SoapUI, as it differs
from one platform to another.
<p/>
Here is one way to test the Web Service of this article using 
SoapUI.
<p/>

1. Within the SoapUI graphical user interface, create a  new SOAP project 
(File : New SOAP Project).
For the project name, enter some identifier (e.g., <code>suntimes_ws</code>).
For the initial WSDL, enter the WSDL URL on the running server, e.g.  
<code>http://localhost:8181/cxf/suntimes_ws?wsdl</code>.
Ensure "Create Requests" is checked. Click OK -- this will generate some
sample requests appropriate to the Service.
<p/>
2. Under 'Projects' in the left-hand pane, you should see a tree that can
be expanded to show the two functions exposed by the <code>suntimes_ws</code>
Service. Expand the function <code>getSunriseTimeUTC</code>  to show
the automatically-generated sample request <code>Request 1</code>.
Right-click <code>Request 1</code> and select 'Show request editor'. This
will bring up a SOAP envelope based on the WSDL file, with ? placeholders 
where you can enter the input values.
<p/>
3. Enter some value for the year, month, day, latitude, and longitude elements 
in place of the ? placeholders.
<p/>
4. Click the green triangle in the top left of the editor window to
run the operation. This should display the SOAP envelope returned
by the service:


<br clear="all"/>
<p align="center">
<img src="suntimes_ws_shot1.png" alt="screenshot" vspace="10" hspace="10"/>
<p>

All being well, the returned value should be the sunrise time appropriate
to the date and location (expressed in UTC time).

<h2>Summary</h2>

In summary, the process for implementing a Web Service code-first, 
using Maven, is:
<p/>
1. Write the Java interfaces; annotate with <code>@WebService</code> and
(perhaps) <code>@WebMethod</code>.<p/>
2. Write the Java classes that implement the interfaces; annotate with
<code>@WebService</code> and indicate the corresponding interface.<p/>
3. Add the code generator plugin to the Maven <code>pom.xml</code> if
you need an explicit WSDL file at build time.<p/>
4. Add one or more <code>jaxws:endpoint</code> elements to the Blueprint
XML file.<p/>
5. Build and test.
